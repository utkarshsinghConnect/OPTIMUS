AWS lamda can be written using various programming languages but when it comes to Java you might be thinking if you can utilise the power of Spring inside Lambda. So thats why I have setup a simple example showing how you can configure Spring boot application as Lambda function.

It is possible to use the Spring config inside AWS lambda using Spring boot, I will update this project soon because that makes a most useful use-case apart from having benefits of dependency injection from Spring.

Just wanted to add that Lambda function in aws have only one endpoint so if you are thinking of having Spring boot configured with multiple endpoints which can be called from outside then answer is "No".
